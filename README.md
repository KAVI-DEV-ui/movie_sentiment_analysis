ðŸŽ¬ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (NLP Project)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Using the IMDB dataset of 50,000 reviews, the model learns to understand sentiment from text data and predict the overall tone of new reviews.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Preprocess raw text data (cleaning, removing stopwords, tokenization).

Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Train a Logistic Regression classifier to detect sentiment.

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Allow custom user input to test the model interactively.
